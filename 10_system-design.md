# System Design

We support you in analysis of your requirements and design a system that covers all of the required functionalities.

Our design is underlying the following general principles if applicable

* minimal source code with minimal 3rd party dependencies - easing maintenance and sustainability of product
* proof-of-performance and code-coverage for code base
* platform and vendor-independent product and development tooling
    freedom of choice for developers
* usage of Free-Open-Source-Software
* complete, fully automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub or your infrastructure

The software design will incorporate best-practices from industry

* API based development - decoupling functionality and implementation
    services and functionalities are 

* Strict tool-supported versioning allowing an continuous product/service evolution

* Proof-of-performance based development
    Ensure that the specified functionality is provided

* Code Coverage verification
    Ensure that the code is healthy and vivid
