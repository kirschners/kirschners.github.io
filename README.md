# Principles

The following principles are the key driving forces in our daily work!

## Sustainability
Our ultimate goal is to create software that is robust, extensible and maintaible over years. Software evolution is the way of building systems that last for decades. As strategies for this goal we promote some strict software development principles.
Modularity, API first and semantic versioning are the essentials.

## FOSS - Free Open Source Software
Whereever possible we are using FOSS software. This allows you to benfit from existing software packages.
And beyond this you can extend, debug & fix or switch the software or library.

## DevOps and Automation
Avoid any tidious, repeating manual tasks during the whole software development life-cycle. Automation is the key for a continuous sucessful extension of functionality. A major goal of DevOps must be the complete automation from checkin to deployment in production. We offer solutions on different technology stacks to reach this goal.

## Testing
Testing in NOT for showing the absence of errors. Testing assures that the requested functionalities are still working within your product. So you should at least create a test automation setup for all the usage scenarions your software must support. We can support you in creation of test beds and selection of tools for a robust and extensible test environment.

## Platform independent
Freedom of choice for the OS during development and operation is nowadays feasible. We support you in setup and operation of development, build and operation environment on windows, linux and mac operating systems.
